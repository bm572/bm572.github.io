<p>Here is my presentation of my NY Times API Project. Within this documentation, I will be showing hints and details of specific parts of my code. My end goal is to show and support my few but many questions in regard to the NY Times API site and the search of articles written on diets.</p>
<p>My project is intended to answer the following questions: How many articles about diet were written within a 6-year span every day on every New Year Day (related towards New Year’s Resolution). Within this project, I was able to see a dramatic change in my findings &amp; were capable of seeing new ones as well. Though my project aim was specifically referencing the annually New Year’s Resolution, much of my findings can be able referenced into a small portion of the date usage with the pandemic of COVID-19.  Now, I will be demonstrating the building blocks of this project.</p>
<h2 id="the-building-blocks">“The Building Blocks”</h2>
<p>Upon approaching this project, I knew there were several packages and technologies I did want to include. Other technologies I included were list methods such as apend(), pprint modules, many parameters, and JSON-- those are some just to name a few. Some packages I did enjoy were included creating a CSV file/Excel sheet and a line plot (matplotlib). Those two factors I felt truly created a large impact on this project and allowed users (and myself) to see the change in a visual way. Beyond the numbers, I do believe the line plot allows for the comprehension of the decrease due to its visual component.</p>
<p>Much of the code, I documented below, is what I call “the essentials”. These parts of the code are what truly made this project come together. These were the buildings blocks that allowed for this idea to carry through-- beginning to end!</p>
<h2 id="block-1">Block 1</h2>
<p>Below are the first results shows of the hits for the search of “diet”. One can see any average of number of the results. On my original code, the average articles shown with diet was an average nine thousand. While creating this project, I was able to see the actual number of articles change every few days or weeks I did verify the results of the NYTime site and on the output of my code. Therefore, I made a note in the actual code of that average number amount that should be present.<br>

<h2 id="block-2">Block 2</h2>
<p>With the code below, I was able to simplify my original topic based on the NYT API site and its filters. With my keyword on the prior code being “diet” I decided to key my search to be based on articles on diet in the section of health. To make it more concentrate, I took at time period gap of 5 years to gain a reference of potential changes. From there, I was able to generate parameters capable of giving me a workable and decent size amount of data information. Now, though the gap is 5 years, I was concrete to make the start and end date be Jan 1st of each year. Not only in homage of theme/idea of New Year’s Resolution, however, its purpose was to also get a precise data with it being the first DAY of the year’s versus a random date.<br>

<h2 id="block-3">Block 3</h2>
<p>This code below essentially “taps” in the large content given from the results and provides specific contents which is in the output. Those specific keywords or content prevalent to this project that I was able to see where the publishing date, keywords/values, and its URLs. By getting this information, I am capable of seeing information that are associated to my original search and topic. As a result, much of the output left me curious in terms of this project’s future progressions and ways those content (specifically keywords) can be used further.<br>

<h2 id="block-4">Block 4</h2>
<p>Below is the line plot or matploblib code that gives the visual of line plot of the start and end (or decrease) of articles with the keyword diet within the “articles” and “health” filters.<br>

<h2 id="block-5">Block 5</h2>
<p>Below is the line plot data that is displayed within a CSV chart. I attached the visual below that essentially explains the code.<br>

<h2 id="conclusion">Conclusion</h2>
<p>To conclude, these are the findings of my NYTimes API Report. Much of the data I discovered helped support the answer to my main question. As described above, those codes listed really became the building blocks to support my main question in terms of find about further information about the reduction/increase of articles written on diet.</p>
<p>When it comes to the term “diet”, it is a constant trend that develops, changes and is constantly discussed in everyday society. While building this project, I was able to see a massive change of that. Since the data shown is inspecting if the amount of articles changed each time each year and within a span of 6 years, I made sure the start and end’s date were Jan 1st. It is to reference the theme of the New Year Resolution and the common theme for diet to be a part of that.  Usually people care about diet, health, weight loss and well-being forthcoming to a new year.</p>
<p>Therefore, if I were to make a followup of this project, I would go beyond the term diet. For example, my future plans would be to find the results or hits of keywords associated with diet. In addition to that, I would discover the result of those new searched keywords and make a CSV and line plot comparing both or multiple terms. I hope to overall compare the results and be able to gain an understanding of both prevalence and importance in terms of topics for articles and society as a whole (in addition to life in a pandemic).</p>
<p>Some packages I would include, in addition to what I have included in the original, would be Textblob so I may be able to do textual analysis. With this specific package, I would be able to find frequencies with certain words. And with the topic of diet, I know there are commonly specified words used in associated beyond my NYTimes results. By further progressing with those options, I know there will be success with this future follow-up project.</p>
